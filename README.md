## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Overview

| File Name             | Description                                |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `city_day.csv`        | Daily pollutant levels per city            |
| `city_hour.csv`       | Hourly pollutant levels per city           |
| `station_day.csv`     | Daily pollutant levels per station         |
| `station_hour.csv`    | Hourly pollutant levels per station        |

> ðŸš¨ Large files were trimmed to *_sample.csv for GitHub compatibility.

## ðŸ§  Big Data Processing Performed

- Loaded datasets using Spark
- Sanitized column names (`PM2.5` â†’ `pm2_5`, etc.)
- Parsed date/datetime columns
- Filtered out null AQI entries
- Aggregated average AQI by year and month
- Exported results as CSVs to `/output`

## ðŸ“Š Sample Insight (from `city_day_sample.csv`)

| Year | Month | Avg AQI     |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 2015 | Jan   | 343.0       |
| 2015 | Feb   | 418.83      |
| 2015 | Mar   | 298.16      |
| 2015 | Apr   | 192.22      |

## ðŸ“¤ Output Files

- `output/city_day_monthly_avg_aqi.csv`
- `output/station_day_monthly_avg_aqi.csv`
